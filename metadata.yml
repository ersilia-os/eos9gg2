Title: Chemical space 2D projections against DrugBank
Description: This tool performs PCA, UMAP and tSNE projections taking the DrugBank
  chemical space as a reference. The Ersilia Compound Embeddings as used as descriptors.
  Four PCA components and two UMAP and tSNE components are returned.
Mode: In-house
Task: Representation
Input: Compound
Input Shape: Single
Output: Descriptor
Output Type: Float
Output Shape: List
Interpretation: Coordinates of 2D projections, namely PCA, UMAP and tSNE.
